# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# spotting_test = Spotting.create(users_name: 'Test', lat: "38.00", lon: "-97.00")

# spotting_test2 = Spotting.create(users_name: 'Test2', lat: "40.67", lon: "-73.94")
